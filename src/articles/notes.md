title: "Adding a 'notes' section to the site"

I can't keep up with all the online discussion threads, and with all my ideas for those threads.
When I have time to work on an article on any subject, I want to reference all the articles on that subject.
But then my article becomes too big of a project to finish in the time I have available.

So I'm doing what quite a few people do in this space: adding a 'notes' section.
The purpose is to help me feel less pressure on my writing. I can put my thoughts on the ongoing conversations out there,
without feeling like I have to full justice to everyone who has said wiser and more coherent things about the topic.

After all, we're not really having a conversation. A conversation is when you're in the same room taking turns speaking and listening.

We are doing something very valuable -- reading and referring to each others' writing -- but in the end it's asynchronous writing.

#### Disclaimer
I shold probably have a disclaimer about my opinion on all these topics being subject to change.

#### What to do with the Feed?
For now I'm going to keep the Notes section out of the RSS feed, which will only contain Articles. While I think about how I want to present the combination of notes and articles.

#### Where to find them
You can find the notes on the [Everything](/everything/) page, below the 'Articles' section.
