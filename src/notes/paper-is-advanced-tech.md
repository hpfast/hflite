title: advanced technology isn't necessary complex

Sometimes, we can forget how advanced seemingly simple technologies are.
It can be tempting to want to erase complicated stuff and start again more simply.
But let's not forget that technologies we take for granted are anything but.

After coming back to web development following a hiatus making things in the real world,
one thought that keeps getting stronger is that I can't wait for this domain to go the way of paper.
Paper, pens and pencils are ubiquitous. That doesn't mean they aren't marvelous feats of engineering and production.
I rely on factory-produced, precision products for the simple, more natural practise of writing on paper.

I think websites should be standardized just like this.
