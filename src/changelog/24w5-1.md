title: 24w5-1 IndieWeb Carnaval on Multilingualism
date: 2024-11-01

This is my submission for the October 2024 IndieWeb Carnaval on the topic of multilingualism!

Appropriately, I added a Dutch translation and page translation links, too.
However, the articles are mostly about how website translation frameworks don't do what I envision.

Added:	[Mixed Multilingual content](/articles/mixed-multilingual-content/) with Dutch translation: [Gemengde meertaligheid](/nl/articles/gemenge-meertaligheid/)
